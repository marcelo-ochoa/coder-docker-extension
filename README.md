Once the extension is installed a new extension is listed at the pane Extension of Docker Desktop.

By clicking at VS Code Web icon the extension main window will display the VS Code Web site once it has loaded.

### Addind extra packages

If want to run/debug NodeJS code a node command must be installed prior you checkout for project.
To simplify that an script is provided as post installation step, here an example of using them:

```bash
docker exec -ti --user root coder_embedded_dd_vm /bin/sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addNodeJS.sh | bash"
```

Other run time extensions:

```bash
docker exec -ti --user root coder_embedded_dd_vm /bin/sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addDocker.sh | bash"
```

```bash
docker exec -ti --user root coder_embedded_dd_vm /bin/sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addJava.sh | bash"
```

```bash
docker exec -ti --user root coder_embedded_dd_vm /bin/sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addPython.sh | bash"
```

```bash
docker exec -ti --user root coder_embedded_dd_vm /bin/sh -c "curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addOracleDevTools.sh | bash"
```

Note 1: If you upgrade VS Code Web Docker Desktop Extension above post installations steps must be re-done.

Note 2: If you add Docker Client/Extension support [addDocker.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-ochoa/coder-docker-extension/main/addDocker.sh) coder_embedded_dd_vm must be restarted, execute:

```bash
$ docker restart coder_embedded_dd_vm
coder_embedded_dd_vm
```

Note 3: If you are using Oracle Free Docker Desktop extension as RDBMS and Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code refer RDBMS host as **host.docker.internal**, for example host.docker.internal:1521/FREEPDB1.

### Persistent storage

Any project that you checkout using git command into /home/coder directory will persistent against Docker Desktop restart also VS Code Web extension upgraded.

## Know kveats

If your Docker Desktop is running in Dark Mode, first execution of VS Code Web will start in Light mode, switch to other pane back again to the extension and it will run in Dark mode. For the next switchs changing Docker Deskop UI colors will change automatically the extension setting.

## Uninstall

To uninstall the extension just execute:

```bash
$ docker extension uninstall mochoa/coder-docker-extension:4.20.0
Extension "VS Code Web" uninstalled successfully
```
